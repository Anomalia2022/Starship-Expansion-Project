Cargo Pod has and orbital and surface door variants
Crew Pod has functional airlock, lights and a place to put docking ports on
Crew Pod together with the Starship Body create an invisible ladder that goes from the airlock to the ground so you can use it in places where jetpacks aren't functional. (I'm looking at you, Tylo)
